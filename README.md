## OpenAPI Forge

⚒️🔥  Effortlessly create OpenAPI clients from the fiery furnace of our forge 

## Design principles

 - **Simplicity** - the generated output is as simple as possible, just code that relates to the task of communicating with an API endpoint
 - **Favour runtime configuration** - to keep the generation process as simple as possible, we favour runtime configuration, e.g. pluggable networking adaptors, logging etc
 - **Generation configuration** - if you do need to configure the generation process, the goal is to make this as simple as possible
 - **Opinionated** - we'll support just one 'official' generator per language
 - **Multi-repo** - each generato has its own repository, reducing overall traffic
 - **Extensively tested** - this repo contains a BDD test suite that is executed against each generator to ensure that it faithfully implements the OpenAPI specification

## Quick start

This project is still in active development, these steps will be simplified and streamlined soon.

Clone this repository, and install locally then globally:

~~~
$ npm install
$ npm install --global
~~~

This will give you access to the `openapi-forge` command. 

Now you can forge your client API ...

~~~
$ openapi-forge forge
 \ https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
 \ https://github.com/ScottLogic/openapi-forge-typescript.git
 \ -o api
~~~

The above command forges a client API for the 'petstore' API, downloaded via the given URL. It uses the `openapi-forge-typescript` generator, which creates the TypeScript API, with the results saves in a folder called `api`.

If you take a look within the `api` folder you'll find that a number of files have been generated. The exact structure depends on the generator you use, with the detail available in the respective README file. 

~~~
% cd api
% ls
 README.md
 api.ts
 configuration.ts
 model.ts
 nodeFetch.ts
 request.ts
 serializer.ts
 util.ts
~~~

The two most interesting files in the above are `model.ts` which has a number of TypeScript classes generated from the various data types in the schema, and `api.ts` which provides a method for each path within the API. 

The following is a very simple example of how you might use this generated API:

~~~
import Api from "./api/api";
import Configuration from "./api/configuration";
import { Pet } from "./api/model";
import { transport } from "./api/nodeFetch"

// configure the API, in this instance we are using the node-fetch library for HTTP requests
const config = new Configuration(transport);
config.basePath = "https://petstore3.swagger.io";

// create an API instance from this configuration
const api = new Api(config);

// make a request
api.findPetsByStatus("available").then((data: Pet[]) => {
  // note the typed response
  console.log("Pet names...");
  console.log(data.map(pet => pet.name));
});
~~~

## Generators

The Forge currently provides the following generators. Each provide documentation regarding the API they generate and its usage:

 - TypeScript - https://github.com/ScottLogic/openapi-forge-typescript
 - C# - https://github.com/murcikan-scottlogic/openapi-forge-csharp (in development)

## User Guide

The CLI tool provided by this repository is the primary interface for the Forge:

~~~
% openapi-forge help forge                                                    
Usage: openapi-generator forge [options] <schema> <generator>

Forge the API client from an OpenAPI specification. This command takes an
OpenAPI schema, and uses the given generator to create a client library.

Arguments:
  schema                An OpenAPI schema, either a URL or a file path
  generator             Git URL, file path or npm package of a language-specific generator

Options:
  -e, --exclude <glob>    A glob pattern that excludes files from the generator in the output (default: "")
  -o, --output <path>     The path where the generated client API will be written (default: ".")
  -s, --skipValidation    Skip schema validation
  -l, --logLevel <level>  Sets the logging level, options are: standard (default), verbose ('verbose', 'v' or '1') 
  -h, --help              Display help for command
~~~

**Generator Hierarchy**

If a URL is given than it assumes that you are giving it a git repository. Otherwise it searches for a local generator folder and finally if no local generator is found it looks for an npm package and installs it if it does not exist.

TODO: Elaborate

## Developer guide

The following is a very high-level overview of the generation process:

 - load - the Forge generator loads the given OpenAPI schema
 - transform - the schema undergoes a number of transformations for the purposes of simplifying the generation process. By convention, any modified or new properties are prefixed with an underscore.
 - generate - the generators are implemented using the [Handlebars templating engine](https://handlebarsjs.com/). 

TODO: Elaborate, how to test generators etc ...
